Blood-Vessel
============

A small rythm game created during the Global Game Jam 2013 in London.

Technologies
============

For this game I am using cocos2d-x and xcode. The interesting part is the way I manage the different screen resolution in order to always have a sharp pixel art style. As the game is very retro-styled I didn't want to introduce any bluring due to the scaling. So I am basically rendering the game on a small texture (160x240) and then I am scaling it to fit nicelly on the devices (iPhone, iPad).
